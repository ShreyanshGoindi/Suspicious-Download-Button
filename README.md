# Suspicious Download Game 🧩💻

A playful Java Swing mini-game inspired by *There Is No Game*.  
It features a suspicious **Download** button that insists it’s totally safe (spoiler: it’s just harmless fun).  
Keep clicking — the button dodges you, teases you, and eventually reveals a secret puzzle that unlocks a fake “download” progress bar.

## 🎮 Features

- 🕹️ Interactive “Download” button that **dodges** your mouse and **denies** being real  
- 💬 Sarcastic pop-ups that insist *“There’s nothing to download”*  
- 🔐 A hidden **drag-and-drop puzzle** (arrange tiles: *not a virus → definitely fun → press here*)  
- 📦 Fake **download progress** bar once you win the puzzle  
- 💀 Completely safe — no actual downloads or file changes (promise!)

## 🪄 Inspiration
Inspired by the meta-comedy game There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension, this project reimagines that concept through a “suspicious download” lens using Java Swing.
